# Starter Files

This folder contains starter files for the three languages we are permitted to use in this class. These files include optimizations for I/O. Feel free to add any other competitive programming tips to help out other students.

### [Main.java]

This starter file contains user-defined methods wrapping BufferedReader and StringTokenizer to allow for faster development. 

### [main.cpp]

This starter file uses a library (`#include <bits/stdc++.h>`) to give cin/cout the same speeds as scanf/printf.

### [main.c]

This is just a basic C starter that uses scanf and printf.
